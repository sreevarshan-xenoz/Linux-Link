## Architectural Mandates

1.  **Low Latency First:** Always prefer binary QUIC streams for real-time data (video, audio, input) over the legacy TCP control channel.
2.  **Zero-Copy Capture:** Use PipeWire for Wayland capture to ensure security and performance.
3.  **Process Isolation:** Use FFmpeg as a sidecar process rather than linking to shared libraries to maintain stability and ease of deployment.
4.  **Hardware Acceleration:** Always probe for VAAPI and NVENC before falling back to software encoding.
