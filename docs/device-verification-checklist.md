# Device Verification Checklist

The ordered battery to run against a real phone (arm64, Android 8.0+/API 26, debug APK with the bridge
`.so`) and a real desktop. Work top-to-bottom: later sections assume earlier ones pass. Record failures as
`FAIL: <symptom>` next to the box; each item maps to the commit/feature noted so fixes land in the right
place.

Several sections are now ticked from real runs (OPPO CPH2359 over LAN and tailnet, 2026-09-22 onward).
What is *not* ticked is not verified, however confident the code looks — and §22 is the standing register
of exactly that, including the one fix that merged without its confirming observation.

## 0. Prerequisites

- [ ] Desktop: `cargo run -p linux-link-server` (or installed server) on the
      Hyprland machine; FFmpeg + PipeWire + xdg-desktop-portal present.
- [ ] Phone: `adb install -r android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
      (build it first: `cargo ndk` for the bridge `.so`, then `assembleDebug`).
- [ ] Both on the same Wi-Fi LAN; phone can reach desktop port 1716 (TCP)
      and the QUIC streaming port (default 50000-range per config).
- [ ] Grant the app POST_NOTIFICATIONS when prompted (connect screen).
- [ ] Desktop: user in `input` group (uinput + `/dev/input/event*` read for
      privacy mode) — `groups $USER` should show `input`.
- [ ] Note which items are Hyprland-specific (window picker, workspace HUD,
      monitor geometry) — retest on a plain session if that's a target.

## 1. Connect + pairing gate (Tier 1 #5, Tier-2 #11b)

- [ ] Enter desktop IP + streaming port + control port → "Connect" opens a session.
- [ ] First connection: Pairing sheet auto-opens (pairing_required default true).
- [ ] "Show PIN on desktop" → desktop pops a notify-send PIN → phone confirms "Paired ✓", button flips to "Paired ✓".
- [ ] Second connect to same host: no pairing prompt (persisted both sides).
- [ ] Manual flow: `linux-link pair` on desktop → type 6-digit PIN on phone → paired.
- [ ] Wrong/expired PIN → clear error, retry works.
- [ ] With an *unpaired* second phone: control features (clipboard, monitors) must stay locked out.
- [ ] QUIC gate (v2 + video): before pairing completes, video must not flow — desktop log shows
      "Streaming session rejected: device not paired" (or "Unpaired device … on v2 QUIC") and the
      phone's status chip goes Down; after pairing, video works with no app restart beyond Retry.
- [ ] QUIC gate over WAN (iroh): unpaired dial is rejected the same way (desktop log + no frames).

## 2. Session shell + video (Tier 1 #5, R2#2, R2#5)

- [ ] Video appears within ~1 s; stats HUD shows fps/bitrate/rtt/e2e/drops, plus the caption naming what
      the rates and the link figure were measured over (§2c).
- [ ] FGS notification is present ("Streaming to <ip>"), survives home/swipe-away attempts; its Disconnect action ends the session.
- [ ] Screen-off for 1 min, wake → stream still live (wake lock + keepalive; plan #13).
- [ ] Drop phone far from AP / saturate link → frames stall, then recover; drops counter rises but no permanent freeze (gap-driven keyframe request, R2#5).
      "Drops" means **frames the phone never received** — the holes in the server's per-frame sequence
      numbers, counted where only the client can count them. So a saturated link must move it (the
      desktop's transport task trims its backlog before a stall clears), while a frame that arrives late
      and intact must not: the number can come back down when an out-of-order frame lands, and that is
      correct, not a bug. A decoder that cannot keep up is a different failure and shows as fps below the
      desktop's `src` rate, not here.
- [ ] Status chip: kill the server → "Down: <reason>" chip + Retry rebuilds after restarting the server.
- [ ] R4 B1 screencopy backend (desktop-observable): starting a stream on
      Hyprland must NOT raise the portal screen-share grant dialog; server log shows
      "Capture started via backend Screencopy". If instead it shows "Capture backend
      Screencopy unavailable (…); trying next" followed by "Capture started via backend
      Portal", the reason is in the line — that's the fallback working, but note it as a
      finding. `LINUX_LINK_SCREENCOPY=0` forces the portal path.
- [ ] R4 B3 capture_backend config override: set `capture_backend = "portal"` in
      config.toml, restart, start a stream → log shows "Capture started via backend Portal"
      and NO screencopy attempt line (pipeline pinned). With `capture_backend = "screencopy"`
      on a NON-wlroots/portal-only Wayland, the server must fail the session with a
      "Capture backend Screencopy unavailable" error rather than silently falling back to the
      portal (explicit intent surfaces). Omitting the key (or `"auto"`) restores the
      screencopy→portal fallback above. An unknown value (e.g. `"v4l2"`) makes the server
      refuse to start with a TOML parse error.
- [ ] R4 B1 idle pacing + freshness: keep the desktop static → `src` fps drops to ≤10
      (damage-driven VFR); move a window → back to target fps within a frame or two, no tearing
      or upside-down frames (YInvert handling).
- [ ] R4 B1 multi-monitor: pick monitor N in the picker → log line "Screencopy capture: output at
      (x,y)" shows that monitor's wl_output origin and frames are its size.
- [ ] R4 C1 codec negotiation, default off: connect normally → server log shows
      "Client codec caps negotiated" with `codec=H.264` even on a HEVC-capable phone
      (allow_hevc defaults false); video unaffected.
- [ ] R4 C1 forced HEVC round-trip: `allow_hevc = true` in config.toml, restart server,
      reconnect → log shows `codec=H.265 (HEVC)`; phone decodes (sniffed `video/hevc`)
      with video within ~1 s and input still mapped. A pre-C1 phone build (no caps
      stream) must still get H.264.
- [ ] R4 C1 HEVC + window crop: pick a window during a HEVC session → encoder rebuild at
      window size keeps HEVC and the phone reconfigures on size change without codec change.
- [ ] R4 C2 startup ladder (desktop-observable): on a box where hardware encoding is broken
      (e.g. force `hardware_encoder = "nvenc"` here — this box's NVIDIA driver predates FFmpeg 9
      NVENC, so the sidecar dies), start a session → server log shows "Hardware encoder unavailable
      (…); falling back to software (C2)" and video still appears within ~2 s on x264.
- [ ] R4 C2 mid-session encoder kill (HEVC session): during a live `codec=H.265` session,
      `pkill -f 'ffmpeg .*vaapi'` (or kill the encoder child seen in `pstree` of the server) →
      log shows "Rebuilt encoder on software rung (C2)", video resuming within ~2 s and the phone
      toasts "Desktop switched encoder — now H.264" (MediaCodec swap re-sniffed from the first
      software IDR).
- [ ] R4 C2 mid-session stall, same-codec: force the supervisor on an H.264 session (kill its
      sidecar child) → video recovers on software x264 with NO phone toast (identical bitstream —
      the server log line is the only signal; that is expected).
- [ ] R4 C2 bottom rung exhausted: with software already live, keep killing encoders until the
      log shows "Encoder bottom rung exhausted; ending session" → stream goes Down cleanly
      (status chip + Retry works), never a silent infinite stall.
- [ ] R4 C2 crop stability: during a software-fallback session, pick/clear a window crop →
      encoder rebuild must NOT re-log the hardware fallback (sticky `encoder_preferred` — a
      rebuild must not re-probe the dead hardware).
- [ ] R4 C3 NVENC power pin (**NVIDIA hardware only — skip on non-NVIDIA boxes**): start an NVENC session (server log "Video encoder sidecar" on `h264_nvenc`/`hevc_nvenc`) → server log "pinned NVENC GPU 0 graphics clock to N MHz"; `nvidia-smi -q -d CLOCK -i 0` shows the graphics clock held at its max. End the session → log "restored NVENC GPU 0 to default clock management" and `nvidia-smi -q -d CLOCK` shows clocks back under adaptive management. On an unprivileged desktop the pin self-declines (log "clock lock refused ... running unpinned") and no reset is issued.

## 2c. In-process VAAPI encode (R4 C4) — desktop/box-observable, no device needed

Note: there is **no `hardware_encoder` key in config.toml yet** — the streaming server constructs
`StreamingConfig` with `HardwareEncoder::Auto` (`streamer.rs`), which `VideoEncoder::new` resolves via
`resolve_encoder(Auto, probe_encoders())`. So on a live session the exact rung is whatever Auto picks;
the deterministic C4 proof on the host is the unit test below, and the desktop-observable checks are the
backend log line + the `LINUX_LINK_VAAPI_DEVICE` override (honoured by both the in-process and sidecar
paths regardless of the config knob). Forcing a *specific* encoder end-to-end is a known future knob,
not part of C4.

- [ ] R4 C4 host proof (no phone): `cargo test -p linux-link-core --lib encoder_vaapi` → 
      `test_vaapi_encode_roundtrip` encodes 40 real frames through `h264_vaapi` on this box's Intel
      iHD node and asserts Annex-B packets + ≥1 keyframe (self-skips green where no VA node exists).
- [ ] R4 C4 device-node selection: on the hybrid Intel+NVIDIA box the probe must land on the
      VA-capable node, NOT the hardcoded NVIDIA `renderD128` — `LINUX_LINK_VAAPI_DEVICE=/dev/dri/renderD129`
      starts a session → server log "Video encoder: in-process VAAPI (h264_vaapi) on /dev/dri/renderD129"
      and **no `ffmpeg` sidecar child** is spawned for the vaapi path (`pstree` of the server). Point the
      override at a VA-less node (e.g. `/dev/dri/renderD128`) → it degrades to sidecar-then-software (C2),
      never hangs.
- [ ] R4 C4 quality (needs a phone): a VAAPI-encoded session decodes with correct color (no NV12 chroma
      shift) and the GOP (fps×2) keyframe lets first-frame render land within ~2 s.

## 2a. Desktop-side session visibility + kick (R4 D2)

- [ ] Consent notice: first phone connect → desktop shows a "Linux Link: a device is
      streaming this desktop" notification with device id + LAN/WAN + peer (headless: the same
      line appears in the server log instead).
- [ ] `linux-link status` during the session → tailscale output plus a "Streaming sessions
      (live):" line (short device id, transport, peer, up-seconds). With no session: "none live".
- [ ] `linux-link kick <id-prefix>` (≥6 chars, or full id, or peer IP) → phone shows the Down
      status chip within ~2 s and the status line disappears; other sessions are untouched.
- [ ] `linux-link kick all` ends every live session at once.
- [ ] kick with no running server → "no running Linux Link server to kick through", nothing
      written; a bogus target logs "kick: no live session matched" and the live session survives.
- [ ] Stale request safety: with no daemon running, hand-write `$XDG_STATE_HOME/linux-link/kick`
      (`all\n<unix-secs older than 60s>`), start the daemon, connect a phone → the session must
      NOT be killed (the expired request is dropped with a warn on first tick).
- [ ] Phone disconnect (normal Exit) → status line goes away within ~2 s; no leftover session in
      `live_sessions.json` (registry deregisters on pipeline exit).

## 2b. Compositor-true latency read (R4 E3)

- [ ] Sanity: on-LAN idle desktop → HUD `e2e` should sit in the low tens of ms and track the
      `rtt` chip sensibly (e2e ≈ capture age + rtt/2); heavy desktop motion → `e2e` rises
      (encoder/queue age grows), never reads 0 once video is flowing.
- [ ] The old bug-shape check: `e2e` must NOT equal `rtt` while frames are under load (it used
      to be a literal RTT proxy).
- [ ] Cross-check (eyes, optional): point the phone camera at the desktop with an on-screen
      clock/stopwatch — the phone's rendered image lags the physical panel by roughly the HUD
      `e2e` figure (± the phone's own present latency, which the probe can't see).
- [ ] WAN session: `e2e` should ≈ rtt/2 higher than a LAN session on the same desktop motion
      (the network-leg term is RTT/2 by construction).

## 2c. Rate and link basis (roadmap 2056)

The HUD's fps/kbps are now diffs over the newest 3 s of received video and its `rtt` is the median of
the session's last ≤8 one-second polls; a caption under the numbers names both, and a figure whose basis
is still filling in is dimmed. What to confirm on a real phone:

- [ ] Right after connect: the caption starts at something like `rates over 0.5s · rtt unsampled` and
      reaches `rates over 3.0s · rtt median of 8` within ~8 s; fps/kbps are dim until the caption says
      ~2.5 s or more, and `rtt` is dim until its first poll (~1 s). A number that arrives already bright
      means the basis is not being reported.
- [ ] The stall check this replaces: freeze the desktop's output (sleep the display, or `SIGSTOP` the
      server) → HUD `fps` and `kbps` must reach 0 within ~3 s and stay there, with the caption still
      naming a real span. Under the old lifetime average this was the bug: a dead link read healthy for
      minutes. Resume → the rates recover within ~3 s, not within a session's worth of averaging.
- [ ] Basis reset: end the session and reconnect to the same (or a different) desktop → the caption must
      come back up from a small span and `rtt median of 1`, never showing a figure or a sample count
      carried over from the session that just died.
- [ ] Portrait legibility: the caption is one line of 10 sp monospace; in portrait on a narrow phone it
      must not wrap into a single-character column the way the six metric chips did before they became a
      `FlowRow`, and must not be clipped by the HUD panel's padding.
- [ ] Optional cross-check: while the caption reads `rates over 3.0s`, `linux-link sessions` for the same
      session should report a mean kbps within the same order of magnitude — the session record averages
      over the whole session, the HUD does not, and a large disagreement is a measurement bug in one of
      them.

## 3. Input paths (R2#4, Tier 1 #2)

- [x] Direct-touch: tap = left click at the touched point. **Verified 2026-09-22 on OPPO CPH2359 → Hyprland:** taps map pixel-exact through the letterbox (phone (540,1230) → cursor (768,432) = desktop center) and click (BTN_LEFT) lands. Under Wayland the injector now uses uinput (enigo/XTEST is inert on Hyprland): motion rides the "Linux Link Virtual Abs Pointer" device (ABS_X/ABS_Y + BTN_LEFT, created eagerly at startup so the first tap is not lost); keyboard/relative ride "Linux Link Virtual Input".
- [ ] Drag = finger-down motion; lift = left release.
- [ ] Trackpad mode: pointer moves without jumping to touch point; tap = click; two-finger = scroll.
- [ ] Mode toggle switches behavior live, no session restart.
- [ ] Keyboard: type letters/digits/modifiers via on-screen shortcuts + remote input — check against `evtest`: Super, Alt+Tab, Ctrl+Alt+Del, PrtSc, Esc, Super+1..9 work (ShortcutBar). (Esc tap verified 2026-09-22; this box binds workspace cycling to Super+Tab, so the bar's Alt+Tab is config-dependent, not a pipeline failure.)
- [ ] holdKey/repeat (e.g. hold an arrow key) behaves.
- [ ] R4 D1 view-only: tap "View-only: off" on the session bar → label flips
      ("View-only: on", amber), desktop log shows "View-only mode changed" (enabled=true), and
      EVERY remote input goes dead on the desktop (taps, shortcuts, workspace chips) while video,
      StatsHud, clipboard sync and monitor/window pickers keep working. Toggle back → input restored
      without reconnect. Re-arm check: while view-only is ON, trigger a stream Retry / monitor switch
      (fresh server pipeline starts interactive) — the phone must re-send the latch once the stream
      is Up again; verify input stays blocked across that rebuild.

## 4. Zoom + display mapping (Tier 1 #6, R3#7)

- [ ] Pinch-zoom in direct-touch mode pans/clamps correctly; taps still land on the visible desktop point while zoomed.
- [ ] Trackpad mode: two-finger still scrolls remotely (no zoom capture).
- [ ] Letterbox: on a phone/desktop aspect mismatch, taps map through the letterbox offset (no systematic tap drift).

## 5. Window + monitor streaming (R3#7, Tier-2 #10)

- [ ] Window picker lists Hyprland windows with title/class/workspace/size + "focused" marker.
- [ ] Picking a window: video re-encodes at window size (encoder rebuild), crop tracks the window, taps map to desktop coords via the screen box.
- [ ] Moving the window mid-session: crop follows only after re-pick (known limitation — crop is static rect).
- [ ] "Whole desktop" clears the crop.
- [ ] R4 B2 (Hyprland): pick a window → server log shows "Streaming compositor-cropped window frames"; partly-occluded window streams correctly (occluder NOT in the video), and only the window's pixels are encoded.
- [ ] R4 B2: close the streamed window mid-session → stream keeps running on full-output frames with software crop (warn log "did not stage"; no session drop).
- [ ] R4 B2 (non-Hyprland wlroots, no export global): window pick still works via software crop exactly as pre-B2.
- [ ] Monitor picker lists monitors via xcap; selecting index N streams that monitor's region; reconnect persists the choice per host.
- [ ] Mid-session monitor switch tears down + rebuilds cleanly (no zombie session — bridge "already active" path).

## 6. Workspace HUD + battery (R3#8, Tier-2 #11a)

- [ ] Workspace chips appear under StatsHud; open/close/focus a window on desktop → HUD updates within ~4 s.
- [ ] Tap a chip ≤9 → Super+N injected → workspace switches.
- [ ] R4 E1: a row of window chips (title/class) shows under the workspace chips on a Hyprland session; tap one → video re-encodes cropped to that window (same as the picker), the tapped chip goes solid/highlighted.
- [ ] R4 E1: re-tap the highlighted window chip → crop clears back to whole-desktop (monitor) view; a *different* window chip tap switches the crop directly.
- [ ] Battery chip shows desktop percentage + charging state; matches `upower`.

## 7. Clipboard + files (Tier 1 #4)

- [ ] Copy on phone → desktop clipboard updated within ~4 s; copy on desktop → phone receives.
- [ ] No echo loop (toggle sync off/on, paste both ways repeatedly).
- [ ] History sheet: 20 entries survive app restart; pick restores local + pushes.
- [ ] Share text to the app from any Android app → lands in desktop clipboard, toast "Sent to clipboard."
- [ ] Share a file (EXTRA_STREAM) → appears in desktop `~/Downloads` (server Share plugin pulls over the staged socket).
- [ ] Reboot phone → history + saved hosts survive.

## 8. Notifications + find-my-device (R3#11c, Tier-2 #11)

- [ ] `notify-send -a Test "Hi" "body"` on desktop → phone notification appears (channel "Desktop notifications").
- [ ] Inline reply from the shade → desktop `replies.log` records it, text on desktop clipboard, confirmation popup; originating notification disappears.
- [ ] "Ring PC" → desktop plays sound 30 s (pw-play/paplay path; silent no-op is FAIL here since desktop has audio).
- [ ] Desktop pushes findmydevice ring → phone alarm loops at max volume 30 s (phone in alarm-volume >0; check DoNotDisturb doesn't block USAGE_ALARM).

## 8a. Control-channel versioning (R4 D4)

- [ ] Reply still works end-to-end after the `kdeconnect.notification-reply` →
      `kdeconnect.linuxlink.notification_reply` rename (desktop-side check): reply from the phone
      shade → `replies.log` records it + confirmation popup (the server only matches the new type
      now, so an old client build's reply would silently no-op — both ends must be from this build).
- [ ] `llVersion` tag is present on our extension packets only: capture the control-channel line
      (e.g. `journalctl`/strace the JSON, or a debug log of `to_wire` output) — a
      `kdeconnect.linuxlink.privacy`/`.audio`/`.state` packet carries `"llVersion":1`; a native
      `kdeconnect.identity`/`kdeconnect.pair`/`kdeconnect.clipboard` packet does NOT.
- [ ] Forward-compat: hand-inject a `kdeconnect.linuxlink.privacy` line with an extra unknown
      top-level field and an unknown body key → server still parses and acts (unknown fields ignored).

## 9. Privacy mode + lock (Tier-3 #15, R4 E4)

- [ ] "Privacy: on" → physical keyboard/mouse on desktop stop responding (`evtest`: grabs held), while phone input still flows.
- [ ] Compositor shield (R4 E4, Hyprland/wlroots): the same "Privacy: on" also paints a full-perimeter red frame on every monitor within ~1 s; the desktop centre stays visible and interactive from the phone (the ring is `KeyboardInteractivity::None`, click-through). Desktop log shows "privacy: layer-shell privacy shield engaged".
- [ ] Leave session with privacy on → release happens (phone app exit); also verify 10-min TTL auto-release by force-killing the phone app mid-grab.
- [ ] Shield tears down with the grab: "Privacy: off" → the red frame disappears immediately; force-killing the phone app mid-grab → frame gone after the TTL auto-release.
- [ ] Non-wlroots desktop (GNOME/KDE/X11, or `LINUX_LINK_SCREENCOPY=0` headless): no shield is attempted — grab still works, no crash, no "shield engaged" log line.
- [ ] "Lock PC" / session-notification "Lock desktop" → screen locks (loginctl path).
- [ ] Without `input` group: clean error, no crash.

## 10. Audio control (Tier-3 #16)

- [ ] Audio sheet opens with volume %, mute state, sink list (matches `wpctl status`).
- [ ] Slider → desktop volume changes on release; mute switch works; selecting a sink routes default output (verify with `wpctl inspect` + real playback).

## 10a. Phone mic share (R4 E2)

- [ ] "Mic: off" tap → RECORD_AUDIO permission dialog; denying it toasts "Microphone permission denied" and the toggle stays off.
- [ ] Granting it → button reads "Mic: on" (amber) and the desktop gains a source: `pactl list short sources | grep linux_link_mic` (or pavucontrol → Recording).
- [ ] Speaking moves the pavucontrol input meter for "Linux Link Mic"; `pw-record --target linux_link_mic /tmp/mic.wav` captures audible speech (play it back).
- [ ] "Mic: on" tap → source disappears immediately; `pgrep -f linux_link_mic` empty (no leaked pw-loopback children after repeated toggling).
- [ ] View-only latched → mic keeps flowing (it is session media, not injected input); input is still dropped.
- [ ] Exit the session while mic is on → source disappears (release-on-dispose); force-killing the phone app → source gone within the QUIC idle timeout (~45 s).
- [ ] Screen off / PiP while mic is on (Android 14+): audio keeps flowing — the FGS carries the microphone type (logcat: no SecurityException, no silent AudioRecord).
- [ ] WAN (relayed or direct) session: the same checks pass over the iroh path.

## 11. WAN over iroh (R1)

- [ ] On same LAN: identity cached (logcat), status shows LAN.
- [ ] Phone on LTE (Wi-Fi off): dial from cached identity succeeds → badge shows "WAN · punching…" then settles to "WAN · direct" or "WAN · relayed — trying direct…", video + input + keyframe-on-gap all work through relays (R4 A1).
- [ ] Desktop reconnects (restart server) → identity re-announced within 30 s, phone re-dials.
- [ ] Hole punching through a real NAT (relay-free if possible): check `directAddrs` paths get used.
- [ ] After both a LAN and a WAN session: `linux-link sessions` shows one line per session with distinct `outcome=` (`lan_direct` vs `wan_punched`/`wan_relayed`), plausible `rtt_ms`/`kbps`, and `dev=` = the paired deviceId.
- [ ] Tail latency (roadmap 2141-2146): the same lines carry `enc_n`/`enc_p50`/`enc_p90`/`enc_p95`/`enc_p99`/`enc_max` and the matching `rtt_*` set. `enc_n` counts frames the encoder actually produced a packet for, so it must be non-zero and of the same order as fps × session duration — a large shortfall is its own finding (frames dropped upstream, or a path that never samples). `enc_p50` must sit near the typical frame time for the encoder rung in use (the log line names the backend at session start), and a deliberate stall — crop to a window, or unplug/replug Wi-Fi mid-session — has to move `enc_max` or `rtt_max` above `enc_p50`/`rtt_p50`. **A line with no `enc_*` at all means the sampling was never wired to the live pipeline: that is a bug, not a healthy session.**
- [ ] Device-reported tails (roadmap 2143-2146, the phone's half of the chain): the same lines must carry `dec_*`, `rnd_*` and `e2e_*` plus `phone_rtt`/`phone_lost`. `dec_n` counts frames the decoder actually rendered, so it has to track `enc_n` within the loss the link imposed (a `dec_n` far below `enc_n` is dropped-or-stalled frames, not a telemetry bug), `dec_p50` must be single-digit ms on a hardware rung and grow when the desktop is cropped to a bigger window, and `e2e_p50` must sit near the HUD's e2e figure for the same session. `rnd_p50` is the rendered-frame interval, so it should be near 1000/fps ms and must jump when the bitrate clamp or a preset slows the link. On a session that never delivered video (rejected, or killed before the first frame) `dec_*`/`rnd_*` are legitimately absent — that is the "nobody measured" case, and `key=0` in their place would be a bug. **The server side of this path is already proven without a phone: `cargo test -p linux-link-server --test session_record -- --ignored --nocapture` drives a real capture→encode→send→receive session over loopback and asserts the record carries all of these tails; what remains device-only is that `H264Decoder.kt` feeds `dec_*`/`rnd_*` with real MediaCodec timings rather than the numbers the test injects.**
- [ ] Transport exposure (roadmap 2151-2158): every line from a session that lasted longer than the 5 s sampler must carry `lost_pk`/`lost_b`/`dgrams`/`tx_b`/`path_chg`/`relayed_s`, and `cong_ev`/`cwnd_pk`/`mtu`/`black` **on either transport**: quinn exposes them on the connection, and the iroh arm reads them off the *selected* path (`Connection::paths()`), so a WAN session riding a punched direct path reports the same set. A WAN line missing them is no longer the expected shape — the earlier "iroh drops the per-path values" claim was read off its connection-level aggregate, which really does discard them — and the only legitimate reason for a gap now is a snapshot taken with no selected path, which is why the field is `Option` and never a `0` pretending to be a measurement. `mtu` must be ≥ 1200 (quinn's `INITIAL_MTU`) and may climb as PLPMTUD probes pay off; `cwnd_pk` must be non-zero on any session that sent video. Walk between Wi-Fi bands, or kick the phone onto cellular mid-session, and `path_chg` has to count it; start a relayed WAN session and `relayed_s` must be non-zero with `outcome=wan_punched` if punching eventually won.
- [ ] Relayed → direct upgrade while streaming: badge flips to "WAN · direct" on its own (iroh keeps punching) and the bridge logs "upgraded from relay to direct path" (logcat). Relayed session must stay usable the whole time, not stall on the transition.
- [ ] Relayed session (R4 A3): within ~2 s of the badge reading "relayed", the desktop log shows "Encoder bitrate target changed" (relay_cap engaged) at effective ≤ 2 Mbit/s followed by "Encoder rebuilt for new bitrate", and picture is visibly softer than LAN/direct.
- [ ] Full-quality override (R4 A3): while relaying, the badge area offers "Full quality: off" — tap → log shows "Relay quality override changed" then a fresh "Encoder bitrate target changed" back to configured (`linux-link sessions` kbps over the next session line). Tap again to re-clamp; toggle survives a stream retry (re-arms).
- [ ] Clamp release on punch-through: start relayed (override off), wait for the direct upgrade → within ~2 s the log shows "Encoder bitrate target changed" back to configured without touching anything.
- [ ] LAN session (R4 A3): the relay clamp never engages (`stats().relayed` is always false on quinn → relay_cap is unbounded); the arbiter task still runs but emits no bitrate-change line until a preset is chosen below or the link starts losing packets.
- [ ] Loss response (roadmap 2053): degrade the link — `tc qdisc add dev <iface> root netem loss 5%` on the desktop, or walk the phone toward the far edge of the Wi-Fi mid-session — and within a few 2 s ticks the desktop log shows "Encoder bitrate target changed" carrying a `loss_cap=` field with effective below configured, then "Encoder rebuilt for new bitrate" and a visibly softer picture. The cut is 20 % per congested tick down to a 1 Mbit/s floor (a configured rate below the floor is never raised to it). Restore the link → the same line reappears **without** `loss_cap=` as the rate climbs back ~10 % per tick to configured, then stops being a term at all.
- [ ] Loss response must not fire on a quiet desktop: hold the screen still (no window movement, no video) for a minute and the log must show no bitrate-change line. Below 100 datagrams in a tick the controller treats the sample as no information, which is the only thing distinguishing "the link is lossy" from "there was nothing to lose" — a bitrate cut on an idle LAN session is a bug, not a measurement.

## 11b. HUD link-profile presets (R4 E5)

- [ ] Session bar shows "Quality: auto" by default. Tap it once → "Quality: max" (blue), then "balanced", "economy", back to "auto" — the button cycles all four.
- [ ] On LAN, pick "economy": desktop log shows "Link-profile preset changed" then "Encoder bitrate target changed" with effective ≤ 1.5 Mbit/s and "Encoder rebuilt for new bitrate"; the HUD bitrate/`linux-link sessions` kbps drop and the picture softens. Native resolution is NOT reduced (only bitrate) — verify the HUD reports the same width×height.
- [ ] Pick "balanced": effective ≤ 5 Mbit/s. A configured rate below a band (low-res monitor) is never raised above it (the band is a ceiling, not a floor).
- [ ] Preset survives a stream retry / monitor switch: choose "economy", trigger Retry — the new pipeline re-arms the preset (stays ≤ 1.5 Mbit/s without re-tapping). Server latches are per-session, so a full reconnect to a fresh `StreamingServer` resets to Auto (phone must re-pick) — expected.
- [ ] View-only interaction: while a preset is active, toggling View-only still drops injected input but the bitrate preset keeps applying (both are control-plane).
- [ ] A preset change mid-action is seamless: no freeze longer than one keyframe; the post-rebuild IDR reseeds the decoder cleanly (no green/garbled persist).
- [ ] Auto is a no-op on (re)connect: with "Quality: auto" and a LAN session, tapping Retry sends no preset packet and logs no "Encoder bitrate target changed" (only the relay floor would fire, and not on quinn).


## 12. Roaming (Tier-3 #13 remainder)

- [ ] Mid-stream, toggle Wi-Fi off → phone falls to LTE → within a few seconds status chip shows connecting and a fresh WAN/LAN session comes up (reconnect-on-new-radio, not live migration).
- [ ] Wi-Fi↔LTE ping-pong with 3 s cooldown: flapping radio must not thrash a healthy stream.
- [ ] In PiP: network change must NOT tear the float session (pip guard).

## 13. PiP + multitask (Tier-3 #14, DeX)

- [ ] "PiP" button → chrome hidden, video-only float with correct aspect (matches decoded frame size after first SPS); input goes to system.
- [ ] Expand back → chrome returns, session uninterrupted.
- [ ] DeX/docked or split-screen: session is resizeable, letterboxing recomputes, taps still map correctly.

## 14. Blackout / pocket mode (Tier-3 #15 remainder)

- [ ] "Blackout" → black screen, "double-tap to unlock" hint, screen dimmed; stream continues (watch desktop from another device or check fps in logcat).
- [ ] Screenshot during blackout → blocked (FLAG_SECURE); Recents thumbnail blank/secure.
- [ ] Double-tap or system back unlocks; back never exits the session while blacked out.
- [ ] Entering PiP while blacked-out auto-clears the overlay.
- [ ] Pocket test: with overlay on, phone in pocket should not send spurious input (touch consumed by overlay).

## 15. Language / i18n (Tier-3 #17 remainder)

- [ ] Connect screen shows "Language" button on Android 13+ (absent on 12).
- [ ] Switch system per-app language to Español / தமிழ் → all screens, sheets, FGS notification text localize (telemetry units, key labels, window titles stay as-is by policy).
- [ ] Mid-session language change (if the OS applies live) → no crash; format strings (`%1$s`) render correctly in both locales.

## 16. Long-run / hygiene

- [ ] 1 h continuous session: memory stable (no decoder leak across resolution changes), fps steady, no watchdog kills.
- [ ] Force-stop app mid-stream: desktop auto-releases privacy within TTL, encoder sessions stop (no server-side zombie capture), siren/WoL relays unaffected.
- [ ] Airplane-mode mid-session then back: clean Down chip + retry, no ANR.

## 17. Foldable / tablet dual-pane (R4 E6)

- [ ] On a foldable folded to half-open (vertical hinge): session auto-splits — desktop video on one pane, trackpad + shortcut dock on the other; tapping/dragging the dock moves the desktop cursor and the finger never covers the video.
- [ ] Rotate to a horizontal hinge → split flips to top/bottom (stream top, dock bottom) and vice-versa.
- [ ] Tablet / unfolded (≥600 dp, no hinge): dual-pane auto-engages with a left|right split.
- [ ] "Pane: auto/dual/single" button cycles the override; forcing Single on a foldable restores the old full-screen layout; forcing Dual on a phone splits it.
- [ ] Toggling panes mid-session does NOT drop the stream (the decode session survives the fold — check fps continuity / no re-Keyframe gap).
- [ ] Direct-touch taps on the video pane still hit the right desktop point (letterbox/aspect-fit recompute for the half-width pane).
- [ ] Shortcut bar appears once — in the dock while dual, under the stream while single.
- [ ] Blackout still covers BOTH panes (whole window), not just the stream.
- [ ] es/ta: "Pane:" and trackpad hint localize.

## 18. Login autostart + tailnet access (server-side)

- [ ] Reboot the desktop → after reaching the Hyprland session, `systemctl --user status linux-link` is active without any manual start (WantedBy=graphical-session.target).
- [ ] Phone reconnects to the auto-started server WITHOUT re-pairing (QUIC identity persisted in `~/.local/state/linux-link/certs/`; a regenerated cert would trip the TOFU pin).
- [ ] Log out / session end → service stops with the session (PartOf), never orphaned.
- [ ] `install.sh` run → unit lands in `~/.config/systemd/user/`, ExecStart points at the real prefix path, prompt enables it; `--status` reports the user unit; `--uninstall` removes it and any legacy `/etc/systemd/system` unit.
- [x] Phone on the tailnet (not on the LAN): connect to the laptop's 100.x Tailscale IP → pairing + video + taps work end to end. **(verified 2026-09-22: oppo-reno8-5g 100.82.170.9 → 100.117.27.83)**
- [x] Re-verified 2026-09-22 with the new home screen over tailnet (both ends on the same Wi-Fi, Tailscale direct path): auto-connect + card tap → session Up (26 fps, 1.4 Mbit/s, rtt ~55 ms, drops 0), server log shows the peer as 100.82.170.9, and a direct-touch tap moved the desktop cursor (1142,37 → 768,390). Note: Alt+Tab and PrtSc shortcut buttons are no-ops on THIS desktop (no Hyprland binding for either) — not transport failures.
- [ ] Phone on cellular (Wi-Fi off): same connect via tailnet IP works (Tailscale traverses NAT). Then iroh WAN fallback (`## 11`) with the two machines on genuinely different networks — still pending (phone cellular was OUT_OF_SERVICE at test time).

## 19. Session chrome refresh (action disc + quick-settings sheet + fading HUD)

Verified on OPPO CPH2359 over the tailnet, 2026-09-22:

- [x] Bottom bar is just the mode chip + floating disc over the ShortcutBar; the disc opens the grouped "Session settings" sheet (Input / Streaming / Desktop).
- [x] Toggle rows act live (clipboard sync, view-only flipped in place; pairing row reads "Paired").
- [x] Value rows cycle (input mode chip + sheet row stay in sync: Direct touch ↔ Trackpad).
- [x] Rows that lead elsewhere dismiss the sheet first (pairing sheet opened over a closed quick sheet).
- [x] Stats/workspace HUD fades to a ghost ~6 s after the link is Up; tapping it restores full alpha and re-arms the timer.
- [x] Exit pill + WAN badge untouched at the top; PiP still hides all chrome.
- [x] es/ta strings shipped with the new keys (31 each, locales in sync).

## 20. Saved-computers home screen (multi-host store + add-computer form)

Verified on OPPO CPH2359 over the tailnet, 2026-09-22:

- [x] Legacy single-host prefs migrate into a card list — "Your saved computers" shows the
      saved desktop with Auto badge, Paired ✓ label, and "stream 4716 · control 1716" subtitle.
- [x] Tapping the card connects straight into a live session (pairing reused, no re-prompt); Exit returns to home.
- [x] "Add computer" opens the form: address field, collapsed "Advanced (ports, wake-on-LAN)" expander
      (auto-expanded when editing a known host), auto-connect switch, disabled Connect until address is valid, Cancel back to home.
- [x] Advanced expander reveals streaming/control port fields (pre-filled defaults) + WoL MAC field with a Send button gated on a valid MAC.
- [x] Remove shows a confirm dialog naming the address and warning that pairing + cached settings go with it; Cancel dismisses without deleting.
- [ ] Wake row + wake status appear only for hosts with a saved WoL MAC (not exercised — none saved).
- [ ] Multi-host scenarios (second card ordering, remove-then-readd) and es/ta strings for the new keys.

## 21. UI polish pass C1–C9 (design system, immersive session, error UX, settings)

First device run (OPPO CPH2359, tailnet) found the icon layer broken on-device —
the runtime-Canvas glyph set drew as a corner dot — so `ui/Icons.kt` now wraps
`res/drawable/ic_ll_*.xml` VectorDrawables tinted through `painterResource`.
`StatsHud` is a `FlowRow`, session chrome is inset-aware and self-describing, and
any touch on the stream summons faded chrome (`PointerEventPass.Initial`, so the
tap still reaches the desktop). The app also gained an adaptive launcher icon.
Items below are re-scored against that build.

- [ ] Theme follows the system light/dark; toggling the mode in Settings restyles every screen immediately (no restart), and the window background matches on cold start (no white flash in dark mode or vice-versa). *Partly verified: the Dark radio restyles Settings immediately; cold-start window colour not yet checked.*
- [ ] Material You: on Android 12+ the palette follows the wallpaper when "Dynamic color" is on; turning it off falls back to the brand palette.
- [ ] Edge-to-edge on all screens: content draws behind the status/nav bars and no control is unreachable under them.
- [x] Session goes immersive: system bars hidden on entry, transient reveal on swipe, restored on Exit/PiP/blackout. After a reveal, video keeps rendering and taps stay pixel-exact (decoder-stability spot check — if OPPO shows black bars, see plan C2 fallback). *Bars stay hidden through a full session and the decoder is stable across reveal + exit; the black-bars fallback never had to be used.*
- [x] Chrome auto-hide: HUD, mode chip, action disc, WAN badge and shortcut bar fade out together ~6 s after link-up; **any tap on the stream** reveals them (the old invisible 30 dp edge strips are gone — they made the menu unreachable); the timer is suspended while any sheet is open; dual-pane keeps chrome forced-visible.
- [x] Error UX: a disconnect shows a centered card with a humanized reason (never a raw Rust string), Retry reconnects, "Re-pair" opens the pairing sheet when the error suggests it; session messages arrive as snackbars, not toasts. *Verified by `linux-link kick all` mid-session: warning-glyph card, "The video link dropped…" copy, and Retry rebuilt the QUIC session end to end (server log + live HUD). The re-pair branch and the snackbar paths were not exercised by this run.*
- [x] Silent-link detection: a desktop-side teardown (kick, sleep, Wi-Fi loss) reaches the error card within ~10 s instead of leaving the last frame frozen under normal-looking chrome — the bridge never reports the drop, so the decoder's frame gap is the liveness signal. *Verified on-device: card appeared 10 s after the kick and a healthy session ran 25 s+ past the threshold without a false positive.*
- [x] Monitor/window/audio pickers: selected row shows the radio + primary-colored headline (the old "· current" suffix is gone); quick-settings rows have leading icons and chevron/switch affordances. *Session-settings sheet confirmed on-device with real vector glyphs, chevrons and switches; the window picker opens and renders its empty state (list contents need a desktop with windows on the streamed workspace).*
- [ ] Pairing sheet: progress bar while waiting, PIN field auto-focused, eye toggle honors the reveal-PIN pref, animated check on success then auto-dismiss.
- [x] Settings screen: every pref persists across an app restart; Language opens the system per-app language picker; About shows version + core version; Home gear opens it, back arrow returns with a slide/fade transition between routes. *Gear + back arrow verified on-device; the Dark radio survived an app relaunch.*
- [ ] Home empty state (no saved computers) shows the desktop glyph + explainer.
- [ ] Siren: a desktop-pushed `kdeconnect.findmydevice {ring:true}` rings the alarm AND shows the full-screen dialog; Silence stops both; the 30 s auto-stop still works if the dialog is ignored.
- [ ] Clipboard sheet: Clear asks for confirmation first (Cancel keeps history); empty state has the clipboard icon.
- [ ] Haptics: tick on the action disc, mode toggle, picker picks and shortcut chips; heavier buzz on Exit; the Settings haptics switch mutes all of them live.
- [x] Session notification: real Linux Link status-bar icon (not the stock eye), Disconnect + Lock-desktop actions carry icons, channel shows its description in system settings. *`dumpsys notification` shows the custom `ic_stat_linux_link` resource and both actions; the shade renders the monitor glyph plus power/lock action icons, and the session channel carries its description.*
- [x] Shortcut bar: System | Workspaces groups with divider and localized captions; chips are ≥32 dp touch targets; key caps stay literal in es/ta. *Now a dark floating pill, legible over video; scrolls horizontally past PrtSc.*
- [x] es/ta: every Phase-C string shipped (locales in sync at 161 each).
- [x] Launcher icon: the adaptive icon renders on ColorOS (phone-into-monitor mark on the brand pine plate) instead of the default Android blob. Needed filled paths in a scaled group — stroke-only adaptive foregrounds are not rasterized there.

## 22. Owed verification register

**This is the gate for Phase 0 of [roadmap-execution-plan.md](roadmap-execution-plan.md) item 5 — nothing
in Phase 1 starts while it is open.** Every line here is a claim the repo already makes that no human has
checked on hardware, or a fix that shipped without its one confirming observation.

### 22.1 One shared control connection (`90d92df`) — the check that was promised

The reconnect storm fix is merged but its own success criterion needs the phone attached:

```bash
adb devices -l                                   # confirm the phone is really there
journalctl --user -u linux-link.service -f > /tmp/ll-journal.log &
# then, on the phone: connect, open the quick-settings sheet, the monitor picker,
# the window picker, the clipboard sheet, watch the battery row for 60 s, exit.
kill %1
```

- [ ] **PASS condition:** zero `Incoming v1 TCP connection from` lines (`server/src/service.rs:330`) after
      the single session-establishing connection, while every sheet and picker above is used.
- [ ] **PASS condition:** zero `Broken pipe (os error 32)` WARN lines from any plugin.
- [ ] **PASS condition:** zero `Kicked 1 stale session(s) due to reconnect storm` from the server.
- [ ] Battery/clipboard/monitors/window rows still show *current* values — the shared connection must not
      trade churn for staleness.
- [ ] The no-session fallback still works: a query issued with **no** live control session must take the
      `oneshot_request` branch (`android/bridge/src/api.rs`, reached from `control_request` when
      `CONTROL_WRITER` is `None`) and still get an answer — that is the path that runs before you connect,
      and it is the one the rewrite could plausibly have broken. Same for `push_packet`'s dedicated socket.

### 22.2 Phase-C items §21 never re-scored on the current build

Eight boxes in §21 are still open and cannot be closed by reading code (they are visual, timing or OEM
behaviour): theme-follows-system + cold-start window colour (358), Material You on/off (359), edge-to-edge
with nothing unreachable (360), the pairing sheet's progress/focus/eye/animated-check flow (366), the Home
empty state (368), the siren full-screen dialog plus its 30 s auto-stop (369), clipboard Clear confirmation
(370), and the haptics matrix with the Settings mute (371).

### 22.3 §20 host-management gaps

Wake row only appearing for a host with a saved WoL MAC (345), and multi-host ordering + remove-then-readd
with es/ta strings (346).

### 22.4 The only genuinely-blocking device test: WAN over cellular (§11)

The iroh path has never been exercised across a real network boundary — the phone's cellular radio was
OUT_OF_SERVICE during the tailnet run, so §1.1 LAN and §18 tailnet results do **not** stand in for it.
Requires: SIM with data, Wi-Fi off, and an external relay or a second network.

### 22.5 Claims that must not be tested because the feature is absent

Recording these here so a tester does not file them as regressions:

- Desktop audio audible on the phone — there is no client-side Opus player (`receiveAudio` has no caller);
  see roadmap-3000 **2791-2800**, and §10's "audio" results are about *control* (routing/volume), not playout.
- The file browser — the server plugin answers, `listRemoteFiles` has zero call sites (**2874**).
- Notification per-app channels, grouping, icons, privacy modes (**2898-2905**).
- Every K (virtual display) and L (macro/automation) behaviour — neither subsystem exists.

## Recording results

Update `AGENTS.md` Current Status (mark verified items / list failures) and
tick plan.md's Tier checkboxes with real device results — items marked
"device behavior unverified" are not done until this file says they are.
