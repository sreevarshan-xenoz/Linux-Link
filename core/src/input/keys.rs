//! The key codes the Android client is able to put on the wire.
//!
//! The wire carries Linux evdev `KEY_*` codes (`InputPacket::KeyEvent`), and two
//! tables on either end have to agree about which ones exist: the client's
//! Android→evdev mapping, and the server's evdev→backend mapping. Neither end
//! can import the other's table — the client's is Android-only and lives in the
//! bridge, the server's is compositor-only and lives in `server` — so an
//! unannounced key added on one side degrades on the other in silence, which is
//! exactly how roadmap 2057-2060 stayed alive.
//!
//! This set is the contract between them. The client asserts it never emits a
//! code outside the set, and the server asserts every code inside the set has a
//! mapping. A key that needs a new entry therefore fails a test on both ends
//! rather than reaching a user as a dead key.

/// Inclusive ranges of evdev `KEY_*` codes the Android client can emit, in
/// ascending order and non-overlapping.
///
/// `KEY_RESERVED` (0) is deliberately absent: the client emits it for an Android
/// keycode it does not know, and both ends treat 0 as "ignore".
///
/// Derived from `android_to_evdev_keycode` in `android/bridge/src/api.rs`; the
/// bridge's own test walks every Android keycode and fails if this list stops
/// covering what it produces.
