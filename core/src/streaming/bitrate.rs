//! Adaptive bitrate control
//!
//! Two things move the encoder's rate, and they are not alike. The presets and
//! the relay floor are *policy*: a known ceiling the user or the link path
//! picks, computable from state alone. Loss response is a *controller*: it has
//! to watch the link over time, decide from ratios, and be able to walk the
//! rate back up again. [`LossCeiling`] is that controller; the live arbiter in
//! [`super::streamer`] owns all of them and pushes the result to the encoder.
//!
//! There used to be a second class here, `AdaptiveBitrate`, trading rate
//! against smoothed RTT. It had no callers: the only way in was
//! `StreamingServer::with_adaptive_bitrate`, which nothing ever called, so it
//! never saw a connection and no RTT-driven adjustment had ever happened. It is
//! deleted rather than revived — RTT belongs in the same arbiter as a measured
//! input when there is a decision to make about it (Phase 5's ABR work), not in
//! a parallel owner that would fight the one that exists.

/// Loss-driven bitrate ceiling — the input the controller here has always had
/// a hook for and never used (roadmap 2053).

/// QUIC already reacts to loss by shrinking its congestion window, but that
/// bounds the *transport*, not the encoder: the desktop keeps producing frames

/// other half of the response, and the only way a lossy link gets a smoother
/// picture rather than a stalling one.
