//! R4 A2 — per-stream-session outcome telemetry.
//!
//! Every video pipeline run is observed by a [`SessionRecorder`] and written
//! as one `key=value` line through a host-registered sink (the server appends
//! to a rotating file under its state dir). This is the instrument the relay
//! research says we need: hole punching succeeds ~70% of the time even after
//! prerequisites, so *how* sessions actually connect on real networks —
//! LAN, punched-direct, or riding a relay — must be measured, not guessed.
//!
//! Wire-level goodput (bytes the transport actually pushed) is logged, not
//! encoder output: backlog trims make those numbers differ, and the transport
//! number is what the user experiences.
//!
//! A record also carries what the transport itself reported — loss, the widest
//! congestion window, the path MTU, how many times the selected path moved, and
//! how long a relay it rode — because "that session was slow" only becomes
//! actionable once it can be blamed on a layer. Those are the library's numbers,
//! and where iroh does not expose one it is absent from the line rather than
//! reported as zero.
//!
//! The last stretch of the chain — decode, render, and the client's own view of
//! the link — happens on the other end of the wire and is invisible from here,
//! so the client ships those measurements back over the streaming connection and
//! this recorder turns them into the same kind of distribution as the encode
//! tail. A record whose client never reported is missing those keys entirely.
